# Networking-Using-Java

I used Socket API to do networking in Java.
I build 2 cmd application in which one is referring to Server and another is referring to client.

so basically client cmd app can communicate with server cmd app.
This what i did.

Myclient.java -> referring to Client app
MyServer.java -> referring to Server app
